# Question 1
# Write a function to print "hello_USERNAME!" USERNAME is the input of the function. The first line of the code has been defined as below.

# def hello_name(user_name):
# """Prints Hello to the User"""
#     print("hello_"+user_name+"!")

               
# Question 2
# Write a python function, first_odds that prints the odd numbers from 1-100 and returns nothing

# def first_odds():
#  """Prints odd numbers from 1-100"""
#     for i in range(1,100):
#         if i % 2 != 0:
#             print(i)

               
# Question 3
# Please write a Python function, max_num_in_list to return the max number of a given list. The first line of the code has been defined as below.

# def max_num_in_list(a_list):
# """Returns the max number in a given list"""
#      print(max(a_list))

               
# Question 4
# Write a function to return if the given year is a leap year. A leap year is divisible by 4, but not divisible by 100, unless it is also divisible by 400. The return should be boolean Type (true/false).

# def is_leap_year(a_year):
# """Returns boolean if a given year is a leap year"""
#         if a_year % 4 == 0 and a_year % 100 !=0 or a_year % 400 == 0:
#                 return True
#         else:
#                 return False
        
               
# Question 5
# Write a function to check to see if all numbers in list are consecutive numbers. For example, [2,3,4,5,6,7] are consecutive numbers, but [1,2,4,5] are not consecutive numbers. The return should be boolean Type.


# def is_consecutive(a_list):
# """Checks to see if numbers in a given list are consecutive"""
#     max_num = max(a_list)
#     if sum(a_list) == max_num * (max_num+1)/2:
#         return True
#     else:
#         return False
